## Project : Email Application 

### Business Problem: As an IT Support Administrator, create an email account for new hires.

With this Email application, you can generate an official email as the expected syntax (i e firstname.lastname@department.company.com). You can determine the department and generate a password. This application can create methods to change the password, define an alternate email address, set the mailbox capacity, and display necessary details(like name, email, mailbox capacity, etc).
